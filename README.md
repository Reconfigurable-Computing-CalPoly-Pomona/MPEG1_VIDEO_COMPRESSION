# MPEG1_VIDEO_COMPRESSION

Overview

This work has beed done by ECE students at Cal Poly Pomona as a collaboration with Xilinx on developing an MPEG-1 Compression Algorithm on a Pynq-z1 FPGA board. The goal of this project was to compare the compression algorithm using both Verilog and Python code. The comparison includes observing the performance metrics on both experiments and concluding which code is more appropriate in different situations.
